			<article>House of 3000 is a live-streaming &amp; media producing organization based in New York City. Ho3K began as a crew of friends in 2007, practicing Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Nintendo Wii on a weekly basis. As they grew, they became more well known within the competitive community for the game, and learned what it takes to run tournaments effectively. By 2014, the next Smash Bros. iteration was released for the Wii U, and the community expanded exponentially! Live streaming became the staple of the local scene, and the most effective method of advertising Weekly tournaments. Ho3K took the next step by partnering with the venue "Xeno Zero" in Chinatown, and began running Weeklies. With a background in programming, Deven Rubin, founder of House of 3000, assured that the Weeklies had a live stream set up for the world to watch! Now, they're all about their high level quality tournaments, to keep the community lively. That isn't where it ends either, they also stream for Regional events in the Tri-state area!</article>
